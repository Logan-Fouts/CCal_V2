## Ideas

- Use custom version of raspbian as OS
- Normal contribution tracking as well as:
	- Tailscale Node
	- Git Webhooks
		- Blink when commit/push/something happens
	- Pi-hole

## Code Infrastructure
- Users setup device through HDMI and only a keyboard
	- (Would ***require a Mini HDMI --> HDMI and MICRO USB --> USB adapters***)
- All settings controlled through JSON files such as: wifi creds, git token, matrix settings, and etc
- LED settings managed through Apache web server written in **plain HTML, CSS, and JS**
- Control LEDS via **PYTHON** including GitHub API requests
### Tech Stack
- HTML
